        <h1> Greps Information </h1>
        <p>
            A grape is a fruit, botanically a berry, of the deciduous woody 
            vines of the flowering plant genus Vitis. Grapes can be eaten fresh 
            grapes, used for making wine, jam, grape juice, jelly, grape seed 
            extract, vinegar, and grape seed oil, or dried as raisins, currants and 
            sultanas.<br /> <br />

            Grapes are a type of fruit that grow in clusters of 15 to 300, 
            and can be crimson, black, dark blue, yellow, green, orange, and pink.
             "White" grapes are actually green in color, and are evolutionarily derived 
             from the purple grape. Mutations in two regulatory genes of white grapes turn 
             off production of anthocyanins, which are responsible for the color of purple 
             grapes.[12] Anthocyanins and other pigment chemicals of the larger family of 
             polyphenols in purple grapes are responsible for the varying shades of purple
              in red wines.[13][14] Grapes are typically an ellipsoid shape resembling a prolate 
              spheroid.
