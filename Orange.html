        <h1> Orange Information </h1>
        <p> The term orange may refer to a number of citrus trees that produces 
            fruit for people to eat. Oranges are a very good source of Vitamin C.
            [1] Orange juice is an important part of many people's breakfast.
             The "sweet orange", which is the kind that are most often eaten today,
              grew first in South and East Asia but now grows in lots of parts of the world.
            <br /> <br />
            Oranges are round orange-coloured fruit that grow on a tree which can reach 10 metres 
            (33 ft) high. Orange trees have dark green shiny leaves and small white flowers with five
             petals. The flowers smell very sweet which attracts many bees.

            An orange has a tough shiny orange skin that holds acid in outside layer. Inside, 
            the fruit is divided into "segments", which have thin tough skins that hold together
             many little sections with juice inside. There are usually ten segments in an orange,
              but sometimes there are more or less. Inside each segment of most types of orange there are 
              seeds called "pips". Orange trees can be grown from pips, but some types of orange trees can only
               be grown from "cuttings" (a piece cut off a tree and made to grow roots). The segments and the skin
                are separated by white stringy fibrous material called "pith". In most types of oranges, the skin can 
                be peeled off the pith, and the segments can be pulled apart with the fingers to be eaten. In some oranges 
                it is hard to take the skin off. Orange skin is often called "orange peel"
