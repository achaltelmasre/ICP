            The tree is evergreen, often reaching 15–18 metres (50–60 feet)
             in height and attaining great age. The simple leaves are lanceolate,
              up to 30 cm (12 inches) long. The flowers—small, pinkish, and
               fragrant—are borne in large terminal panicles (loose clusters). 
               Some have both stamens and pistils, while others have stamens only.
                The fruit varies greatly in size and character. Its form is oval, 
                round, heart-shaped, kidney-shaped, or long and slender.

                 The smallest mangoes are no larger than plums, while others
                  may weigh 1.8 to 2.3 kg (4 to 5 pounds). Some varieties are vividly
                   coloured with shades of red and yellow, while others are dull green.
                    The single large seed is flattened, and the flesh that surrounds it
                     is yellow to orange in colour, juicy, and of distinctive sweet-spicy
                      flavore.
